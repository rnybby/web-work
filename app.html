    <h1>Part One: Solidify Terminology</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>What is HTTP?</b><ul>
            <li>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, it is how browsers and servers communicate.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><b>What is URL?</b><ul>
        <li>URL stands for Universal Resource Locator and it is the address of a source.</li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><b>What is DNS?</b><ul>
            <li>DNS stands for Domain Name System and it contains the IP address and hostname of a server like a phonebook</li></ul></li>

        <li><b>What is query string?</b><ul>
            <li>Query string provides extra information, that  might be used to change a page.</li></ul></li>

        <li><b>What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?</b><ul>
            <li>We have GET and POST. GET - gets some data from the server (most pages, search forms) and POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server).</li></ul></li>

        <li><b>What is an HTTP request?</b><ul>
            <li>When you point to webpage on a server your browser first sends a request to the server with the exact URL you want.</li></ul></li>
        
        <li><b>What is an HTTP response?</b><ul>
            <li>After the browser sends a request to the server, the server responses back with the exact HTML text for that page.</li>
        </ul></li>
        
        <li><b>What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.</b><ul>
            <li>HTTP Header a field of an HTTP request or response that passes additional context and metadata about the request or response.
                For example, a request message can use headers to indicate it's preferred media formats, while a response can use header to indicate the media format of the returned body.
            </li>
        </ul></li>

        <li><b>What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>First, the hostname will turn into the IP address. Then, it'll connect to the IP address. Finally, using the HTTP Protocol ask for /some/page.html.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
